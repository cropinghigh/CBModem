  Introduction
 =============================================================================

  tavrasm is an assembler for the Atmel AVR family of micro-controllers. 
  It uses a syntax similar to the one found in the Atmel AVR DOS assembler.
  Some of the features includes:

   - Super-set of Atmel AVR assembler. 
   - Macros in macros. 
   - Save Intel HEX, Motorola S-record, Generic and binary output. 
   - More than 100 warning/error messages. 
   - Atmel object files compatible with Atmel's AVR Studio. 
   - C escape characters in char/string literals. 
   - Runs on (win)DOS, Linux, OS/2, Solaris, ...
   - Free software released under GPL.

  Installation
 =============================================================================

  Copy the tavrasm executable (tavrasm.exe for OS/2 and DOS) to a
  directory in your path.

  Running
 =============================================================================

  Just type 'tavrasm file.asm'. This will generate an Intel HEX output file
  ('file.hex'). To get help, type 'tavrasm' with no arguments.

  Compiling
 =============================================================================

  tavrasm should compile on most systems that are supported by gcc.
  I haven't check for endianes, so this might be a problem if
  anybody wants to compile it on non-i386 systems (mail me, and I will 
  fix this). 

  Check the makefile for additional information.

  Systems supported
 =============================================================================

  Linux/x86:	I wrote parts of tavrasm on a Linux/x86.

  Linux/PPC:   	Andreas Bogk reports that he has successfully compiled
               	tavrasm on a LinuxPPC machine. 

  Linux/Alpha: 	Now works (after a little bug fix).

  FreeBSD:	Lots of people runs tavrasm on FreeBSD.

  Sparc:	I have received reports from serveral people running
                tavrasm on a Sparc station.

  OS/2:		I wrote the initial version of tavrasm on OS/2 (using emx)

  History
 =============================================================================

  1.22 - Several updates for ATmega (new devices, extended I/O etc.)

         Thanks to Dariusz Kowalewski for these updates.

         Fixed problem with .db 00

         Thanks Mike Hall for reporting this.

         Fixed 'symtab = (new (symbolTableEntry*))[size]' blunder. How that
         ever slipped by GCC is beyond me :-) Lots of compilers won't even
         allow it.

         Thanks to Steven Saunderson for reporting this.

  1.21 - Added support for the ATMega 128

         Thanks to Jens Wilhelm Wulf for supplying the patch.

         Fixed problem with the .align directive.
         
         Thanks to Rolf for reporting this.

  1.20 - Added .align directive.

         Thanks to John Romein for supplying the patch to implement this.

  1.19 - Messed up applying some of the pathces in 1.18 :-(

  1.18 - Added support for specifying unsigned integer values [0; 2^32-1]

         Thanks to Richard Gerrits for pointing out the problem.

         Added support for specifying Z/Y/Z for adiw, sbiw and movw.
         
         Thanks to Richard Barrington for suggesting this.

         Added support for a bunch of Mega devices.

         Thanks to Andreas Schwarz for supplying a patch with these.

         Fixed problems compiling with GCC 3.2

         Several people supplied patches, but I was just too busy
         integrating them.

         Thanks to Patrick Dreker for supplying the final patch.

  1.17 - Added support for the BYTE1 (same as LOW) function.

         Thanks to Timothy Lee for supplying this patch.

         Fixed path delimiter problem in include path. I used 
         DOS style '\' causing problems on *NIX.

         Thanks to Timothy Lee for reporting this.

  1.16 - Fixed problem with long macro names.

         Thanks to Richard Gerrits for reporting this.

         Increased maximum identifier length to 64 (and no, this was
         not the fix to the problem above :).

         Added support for using DOS (\13\10) files on *NIX systems.

         Change URL to www.tavrasm.org in help/README/...

  1.15 - Added support for multiple include path. Use '-I' to specify
         additional include paths.

         Thanks to Brian Rhodefer for adding this.

         Added option to omit address extension record in Intel HEX files.
         Use '-h' to omit address extension record.

	 Released November 2000

  1.14 - Added support for forward .org statements. Use '-f' to supress
         warnings.

         Thanks to Brian Rhodefer for suggesting this.

	 Not released

  1.13 - Some overall clean up and german translations.

         Added support for local labels. Use _ as the first charcter of a
         label to give it local scope between two non-local labels.

         Specify -x to enable local labels.

         Changed range checking code to allow negative numbers in some cases.

         Thanks to Kurt Stege for implementing local labels and cleaning up
         the code.

	 Not released

  1.12 - Added the 'spm' instruction (forgot the first time around)

	 Thanks to Jochen Pernsteiner for pointing this out.

	 Released December 1999

  1.11 - Now the Alpha problem is fixed (I forgot to move  fix from test to
         release source).

	 Fixed promlem with detecting supported instructions (Introduced in 
         1.10) - Thanks to Mark V. Vaysman for reporting this.      

	 Removed carriage returns from source, so it will compile under
         *NIX without problems. Thanks to Todd M. Squires for reporting this.

	 Released December 1999

  1.10 - Added the new instructions: 'eijmp', 'eicall', 'espm', 'mulsu', 
         'fmul', 'fmuls', 'fmulsu', 'muls', 'movw', 'elpm'. 

         Changed behaviour of 'lpm' according to Atmel specs.

	 Added spanish translation - Thanks to Lluis Ballester for supplying
	 the Spanish translation.

	 Fixed .endm problem (it had to be lower case) - It was reported
         on comp.arch.embedded by Ben Cantrick.

	 Released December 1999

  1.09 - Fixed problem with BRBC/BRBS (they did not work). I used the status 
	 bit number for both source and destination operand (word of advise -
	 don't use variable names like 'values' and 'valued' in the same 
	 context :)

	 Fixed problem when compiling on Alpha's

	 Thanks to Todd M. Squires for reporting these (and supplying a patch
	 for the Alpha problem).

	 Released December 1999


  1.08 - Fixed problem with SBR (Set Bits in Register). This is the same
	 as ORI, but the SBR version had a bug (one of those that generates
         faulty code), bit 0 was always set. 

	 Thanks to Dean Huxley for reporting this (and supplying a patch).

         Added support for AT90S4433 (similar to 4414/4434).</li>

	 Released July 1999


  1.07 - Added support for using PC as program counter (i.e. rjmp PC+4),
	 EC as eeprom counter and DC as data counter.

	 Thanks to Adam Dybkowski for suggesting this.

	 Released May 1999


  1.06 - Added support for wrapping branches and relative call/jumps
	 Use the '-a' switch to enable this feature.

	 Thanks to Jochen Pernsteiner for suggesting this.

	 Restored the generic hex format. The generic hex format
	 disappeared in version 1.03 (when the default file format was
	 changed to Intel Hex). Use the '-g' switch to generate
	 generic hex (files that looks like this: "000021:f7f0").

	 Released May 1999


  1.05 - Fixed problem with detection of binary numbers like '0b010101'.
         This was bug was introduced by the new hex detection feature in
         V. 1.04 :( 

	 Thanks to Randy Ott for reporting this.

         Fixed problem with memset of context stack that caused the winDOS
         version to crash on some systems (strange that Linux/NT did not
	 detect this obvious memory violation).

         Thanks to Steve Maddigan for reporting this, and to my friend
	 Henning for finding the bug.

	 Released May 1999


  1.04 - Fixed problem with tabs after include filename, thanks to
         Andreas Bogk for reporting this. 

	 Added support for specifying hex values like 1AB without '$' or '0x'
	 thanks to Andreas Bogk for suggesting this.

         Changed distribution format, so source i now located in a
	 sub-directory.

	 Released April 1999


  1.03 - Modified to support Intel hex as the default.

	 Now automatically determines the output file name.

         Exits with a count of the number of errors (for make).
